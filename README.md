# Netflix_Data_Insights

## üöÄ Overview

This project delves into my family's Netflix viewing activity to uncover fascinating habits, trends, and patterns. It serves as a practical application of data engineering and data science principles, focusing on building a robust data pipeline to extract, transform, load (ETL), and analyze personal viewing data.

## üéØ Objectives

* **Simulate an ETL process:** Practice and demonstrate foundational data engineering skills by processing raw Netflix activity data.
* **Analyze viewing patterns:** Uncover insights into content preferences, peak viewing times, and duration trends across different profiles.
* **Visualize data insights:** Create clear and **interactive** visualizations to present findings, making complex data easily understandable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

* **Python:** The core programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Pandas:** Essential for efficient data loading, cleaning, and transformation.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations within data analysis.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For static data visualizations.

## üìä Key Insights

This project summarizes approximately four years of Netflix activity, from early 2022 to mid-2025.

### Movies & TV Shows

* **Total watch time:** Over 2250 hours of content watched, with a strong preference for TV shows.
* **Content preference:** My family generally watches more TV shows than movies.
* **My personal top content:**
    * **Longest (re)watched movie:** "The Patriot"
    * **Longest (re)watched TV shows:** "Love, Death & Robots" and "Turning Point: The Bomb and the Cold War"
* **Family favorites:** "All Quiet on the Western Front" is the most (re)watched movie across the family.
* **Viewing habits:** The analysis reveals popular viewing times for different family members and their content preferences (movies & mobile games).
* **Unusual activity explained:** Insights into peculiar viewing patterns, such as the mysterious early morning activity for one profile, suggest potential background playback or accidental starts rather than active viewing.

### Mobile Games

* **Favorite games:** "Cats & Soup" is a family favorite, while "Dead Cells" (my preferred game) boasts over 25 hours of gameplay.
* **Peak gaming times:** Most game sessions occur in the morning, evening, and during lunchtime.

## üì¶ How to replicate

To run this analysis and generate the insights yourself, follow these steps:

1.  **Download Your Netflix Data:**
    * Log in to your Netflix account and go to the "Account" page or directly follow this address: [https://www.netflix.com/account/security](https://www.netflix.com/account/security).
    * In the "Access and Privacy" section, click on "Personal info access."
    * Click the "Submit request" button at the bottom of the page. You will receive an email from Netflix to accept the terms for downloading personal information.
    * After some time (it can take up to half a day), you will receive another email with a link to download your data.
    * Locate the `ViewingActivity.csv` file within the downloaded data archive.

2.  **Project Setup:**
    * Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
    * Place the `ViewingActivity.csv` file (and potentially `Games.csv` if available) into the main project directory.
    * **Create a virtual environment** (highly recommended) for dependency management:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **Install required packages** from `requirements.txt`:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

3.  **Run the Analysis:**
    * Open the Jupyter Notebook (e.g., `Netflix_Data_Insights.ipynb`) in your preferred environment.
    * Run all cells to execute the data processing, analysis, and visualization steps.
