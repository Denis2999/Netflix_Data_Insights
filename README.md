# Netflix_Data_Insights

## Overview
This project analyzes my family's Netflix activity data to explore viewing habits, trends, and patterns. The goal is to build a data pipeline to process, transform, and derive insights from the dataset while enhancing skills in data engineering and data science.

## Objectives
- Simulate an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
- Analyze viewing patterns and behaviors.
- Visualize data insights through interactive dashboards.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Netflix allows the downloading of personal behaviour data. This data can be analysed to gain insights into your viewing behaviour.
The purpose of this notebook is to practice some data visualisation on Netflix's personal behaviour data.

To download your data from Netflix, follow these steps:
- Log in to your Netflix account and go to the "Account" page or just follow this address: https://www.netflix.com/account/security
- In the "Access and Privacy" table there will be "Personal info access". Click on it
- Click on the "Submit request" button at the bottom of the page. You will receive an email from Netflix to accept the terms for downloading personal information.


After some time you will be able to download your data. In my case, it took them half a day.

For the running Jupyter Notebook, it is required to put data in the same folder as the repository and download requirements from requirements.txt. I suggest creating a virtual environment.


Here are my movie insights:
- The data is summarised for four years. From the beginning of 2022 till 2025. During this time, I watched total a of 80 hours and most of them were TV shows
- Based on my Netflix viewing data, it appears that I tend to watch more TV shows than movies.
- The longest (re)watched movie for me  was "The Patriot"
- Two of the longest (re)watched TV shows for me  were "Love, Death & Robots" and "Turning Point: The Bomb and the Cold War"
- The most (re)watched movie across the family is "All Quiet on the Western Front"
Here, you can also see the most popular time you use Netflix. And your family members. Also, you can see the other family members' preferences in movies and mobile games.

Here are my personal mobile games insights:
- One of the family members loves to play "Cats & Soup"
- I see my preferred game "Dead Cells" in the second place. More than 25 hours of gameplay
- The most popular game sessions are in the morning, evening and lunchtime
